# GameFrameV2_WiFi
Particle Photon firmware for Game Frame

The Wi-Fi adapter is available for purchase at [ledseq.com](http://www.ledseq.com). If you wish to assemble your own using a Particle Photon and some male headers, you can [order a blank PCB from Osh Park](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/2mD6bMMA). Just make sure to solder the male headers first, and then the Photon as illustrated in the photos on this repo.
